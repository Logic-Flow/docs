# Upgrade from v1.1 to v1.2

Version 1.2 is still under development, you can download [1.2.0-next.x](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@logicflow/core?activeTab=versions)

### Breaking Changes

- LogicFlow `1.2` version does not change dramatically from `1.1` version.  In `1.2` version, we fixed some spelling errors in the source code, but they do not involve the API provided by LogicFlow. However, LogicFlow provides an inheritance-based customization mechanism that allows developers familiar with the LogicFlow source code to bypass the API on the LogicFlow documentation for highly customizing, so we chose to release a new minor version. If you are developing based on the API or examples provided by LogicFlow, you can upgrade directly. If you have customizations that bypass Logicflow's API, you can install the VSCode plugin `Code Spell Checker` to quickly find spelling errors.

- LogicFlow in `1.1` provides the ability to automatically expand the canvas area when dragging nodes or connecting lines to the canvas boundaries. Referring to the subsequent feedback received, this interaction will bring some interpretation cost, so this feature is disabled by default in `1.2` version. You can enable this feature by providing the `autoExpand` parameter with a value of `true` when initializing LogicFlow. The default is `false`.
